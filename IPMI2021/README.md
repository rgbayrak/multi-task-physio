### The extension of the RV project was initially submitted to IPMI 2021 (reject), later submitted and accepted to MICCAI 2021. 
In this version, MICCAI 2021, we trained models using transformer and a deep LSTM architecture and applied directly to 3 task data.
Test: Emotion Processing, Social Cognition and Working Memory tasks N = 214 (107 subjects). 
Train: Resting State N = 1500 (375 subjects).
